Description
-----------
Libhash is a Library providing access to easy-to-use hash table implementation.
It is not fast enough, since it is a toy project(not a production one).
Currently it provides the following set of the hashing functions:
 - division hash
 - multiplication hash
 - hash function for string(K&P The Art of Programming)
 - open address hashing
